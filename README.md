# planner

For this project I created a work-day planner that would help organize a work-day wit normal business hours.

The biggest challenge with this project was the JavaScript which I am still trying to get better at.

The screenshot of the deployed webpage doesn't have the colour that it's meant to, because I took the picture outsite of the workday hours.

The following is a screenshot of the deployed webpage:
